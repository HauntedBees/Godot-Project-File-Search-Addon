# Project File Search
A basic file search for Godot 4.3+ similar to the ones seen in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

## Installation
Download from the Godot Asset Library or from GitHub, and ensure the `addons/project_file_search` folder is added to your `addons` folder. Then in Godot go to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins` and enable `Project File Search`.

## Usage
Press `Ctrl+,` to bring up the search window. Type at least 4 characters to populate the search results, which will search everywhere in your project except the `/addons` folder, then use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the results and press `Enter` to open the selected file, or use your mouse and click the file you want to open.

## Settings
If the *Advanced Settings* are enabled in the `Project Settings > General` tab, an `Addons/Project File Search` section exists containing customization options for the add-on.

### Character Search Limit
The number of characters you need to type before search results begin populating. As this add-on iterates your entire project structure recursively, it may perform poorly if this value is too low.

### Included File Formats
Only file formats listed in this array will appear in the search results. By default, this includes `.tscn` scene, `.gd`/`.cs` script, `.gdshader` shader, and `.res`/`.tres` resource files. As this add-on only opens files in Godot, file formats that Godot doesn't recognize probably shouldn't be included in here.

## License
This add-on is MIT licensed meaning you can do what you want with it, and since it is an editor add-on and not something that will actually end up in your games, no attribution is needed (at least that's my interpretation/intention). I don't know what the whole deal would be if I gave this a copyleft license; this exists to be useful, not to trick developers into accidentally forcing their games to be copyleft. However, if you do make changes to improve this add-on, keeping your changes hoarded on your machine and not sharing them online as well will give me the sad face.
